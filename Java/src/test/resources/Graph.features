Feature: Graph functionality

  Scenario: Add a node to the graph
    Given an empty graph
    When I add a node "A"
    Then the graph should contain the node "A"

  Scenario: Add an edge to an undirected graph
    Given an undirected graph with nodes "A" and "B"
    When I add an edge between "A" and "B"
    Then the graph should contain the edge "A" -> "B" and "B" -> "A"

  Scenario: Add an edge to a directed graph
    Given a directed graph with nodes "A" and "B"
    When I add an edge from "A" to "B"
    Then the graph should contain the edge "A" -> "B" but not "B" -> "A"

  Scenario: Add an edge with a non-existent node
    Given an undirected graph with a node "A"
    When I add an edge between "A" and a non-existent node "C"
    Then an exception should be thrown with the message "Both nodes must exist in the graph"

  Scenario: Add a null node to the graph
    Given an empty graph
    When I add a null node
    Then an exception should be thrown with the message "Node cannot be null"

  Scenario: Add a null edge to the graph
    Given an undirected graph with a node "A"
    When I add an edge from "A" to null
    Then an exception should be thrown with the message "Nodes in an edge cannot be null"
